            <h1>About Us & What We do</h1>
        
    Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families of children under the age of 18 years old that
    are diagnosed with a disability.
    
    <p>After years of supporting various well known kids charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was 
    started in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an 
    increasing percentage of donations being used to cover overheads instead of going 
    to the ones who need it most, the Kids.
    </p>
    
    <p>With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of the donations received are used for the children, 
    with the running costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after 
    by the Directors and friends.
    </p>
    Since starting, we have raised over $750,000 and have provided over 150 grants 
    covering mobility aids, walking frames, specialised clothing and other assistance to 
    these very special kids.
   
    <p> We are focussing on gaining support and donations through the generosity of 
    Directors, individuals, corporations, estate trusts and through various yearly fund 
    raising activities.These includes the Mercedes Benz Polo Championships held each 
    September and a Brisbane Businessman’s lunch held each November.
    </p>
    Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office endorsement in May
    2001 to allow donations over $2 to be tax deductible.
